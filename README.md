*FullCalendar V4*

Provides a ```<isExposed>false</isExposed>``` that loads the FullCalendar static resources and displays a calendar. This component is capable of rendering events on any custom object along with standard objects like ```event```.

## Public Methods
```setEvents``` is a public method that takes in formatted events, and renders them to the calendar. By default the function will remove the current events and render the new ones.
```ruby
 @api setEvents(events)
```
> For event info, see the [Event Object](https://fullcalendar.io/docs/event-object)

## Views
The calendar provides multiple views in order to display the events. 

The initial view is ```dayGridMonth```; views provided are ```['listWeek', 'dayGridMonth', 'timeGridWeek', 'timeGridDay'] ```.

Examples of each view are provided below:

<details>
    <summary>
        listWeek
    </summary>
